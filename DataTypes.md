# This document will cover datatype comparisons in C

### Datatype comparisons
Arrays | Linked Lists | Hash Tables
------ | ------------ | -----------
Fixed Size | Dynamic Size |
Inefficient insertions and deletions | Efficient insertions and deletions | 
Random access i.e. efficient lookup if you have the index | No random access |
Can result in wasted memory | No wasted memory |
Sequential access is faster (Reason: elements in contiguous memory locations) | Sequential access is slower(if memory not contiguous) |
